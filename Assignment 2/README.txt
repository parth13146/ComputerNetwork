About the assignment
--------------------

I have used https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html to use socket programming concepts like accept, socket, connect, using getaddressinfo api to get started with the project.  

I have used map to store the state with the list of cities as the value. After storing the map, I have removed the duplicate cities for a given state. 

To get the dynamic port number for clients, I have used getnameinfo api.
